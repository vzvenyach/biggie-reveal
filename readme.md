# Biggie-Reveal

Inspired by[Biggie](https://github.com/tmcw/biggie) and [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js), this is a grown-up, but hacker-friendly HTML presentation framework. 

## Usage

`git clone https://github.com/vzvenyach/biggie-reveal.git && cd biggie-reveal`

Make changes to `slides.html` and then, when you're ready:

`./init.sh`

Go to <http://localhost:3000> and enjoy!

## Slides

Slides are written in markdown with slides separated by `---`. That easy.
