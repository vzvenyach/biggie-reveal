# Biggie-Reveal

Inspired by [Biggie](https://github.com/tmcw/biggie) and [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js), this is a grown-up, but hacker-friendly HTML presentation framework. 

## Usage

Download the app and install dependenciesL

```
git clone https://github.com/vzvenyach/biggie-reveal.git
cd biggie-reveal
npm install
```

Make changes to `slides.md` and then, when you're ready:

```
npm run serve
```

Go to <http://localhost:3000> and enjoy!

If you want to edit slides and watch for changes:

```
npm run watch
```

And, if you want to watch & serve:

```
npm run start
```

## Slides

Slides are written in markdown with slides separated by `---`. That easy.
