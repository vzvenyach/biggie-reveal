# Hello World!
---
I'm the biggie reveal.
---
I'm powered by [Reveal.JS](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).
---
And inspired by [Biggie](https://github.com/tmcw/biggie).
---
All you need to do is edit `slides.md` in markdown.
---
And then run:

`npm run start`
---
Browse to <http://localhost:3000>.
---
If you need to print to pdf, go 'head and put `?print-pdf` after the URL.
---
Make beautiful presentations like a pro...
---
... and if you don't know, now you know.
